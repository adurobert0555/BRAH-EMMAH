 Step-by-Step: Force Push Local Files to GitHub
⚠️ Important: Only do this if you're sure the current version on your machine is the one you want to keep.

🔹 1. Open Terminal in VS Code
Click Terminal > New Terminal or use shortcut:
Windows: Ctrl + ~
Mac: Cmd + ~

🔹 2. Check you're on the main branch:
bash
Copy
Edit
git branch
If you're not on main, switch to it:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout main
🔹 3. Stage all your updated files:
bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
🔹 4. Commit your changes:
bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Replaced old files with new version"
🔹 5. Force push to GitHub (⚠️ this will overwrite remote):
bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main --force
✅ What This Does:
Deletes differences from GitHub's version

Replaces everything with your local files

Avoids any merge issues or duplicates
